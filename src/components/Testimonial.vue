                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg">Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear
                        is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens
                        us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who
                        are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is
                        nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are
                        all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is
                        within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we
                        unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own
                        fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</p>
